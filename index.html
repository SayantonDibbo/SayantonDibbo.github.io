## About Me

I'm Sayanton Dibbo, a Ph.D. Candidate and Cybersecurity Cluster Research fellow in the CS @ <a href="https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.adambreuer.com/">Adam Breuer</a>. Before joining Dartmouth, I received my MS in CS from the <a href="https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a>. 
My research interests span the areas of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Secure & Trustworthy AI/ML modeling.  I'm exploring (1) analyzing data-driven AI/ML systems, including foundation models  (e.g., LLMs and Multimodal systems), and (2) focusing on security and privacy aspects of the data involved in traditional ML as well as foundational models to investigate attacks (adversarial and privacy) and develop novel defense techniques to enhance robustness. My research spreads over various data modalities, including images, tabular, audio, and text data.

In my free time, I love to travel to new places.
